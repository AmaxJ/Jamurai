# [Jamurai](www.jamurai.io)

Jamurai is a realtime collaborative playlist application for
crowd-sourcing music selection at parties. 

###Features
Users can create rooms (called "Dojos") where songs are submitted to construct a playlist. Other 
users can then vote on submissions, determining the order in which the songs will play.

When a song submitted by a user is played, they are rewarded
with "power ups" which give their up or down votes more
weight.
